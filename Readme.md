# ASPxSpreadsheet - How to modify a document

This example demonstrates how to modify a document in the ASPxSpreadsheet control.
The main idea of this approach is to perform a callback using the  [PerformCallback](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientSpreadsheet.PerformCallback%28parameter%29) method and modify a document in the  [Callback](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxSpreadsheet.ASPxSpreadsheet.Callback) event handler.
